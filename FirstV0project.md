# AI Assistant Prototype 🤖  
Created during the **Build Fellowship – From Zero to Prototype** (Jul–Aug 2025)

## 🧩 Overview  
This project is a **multi-AI assistant prototype** built using **V0** and **Figma**.  
It includes three interaction modes — **Basic**, **Auto**, and **Manual** — designed to show how users could switch or combine different AIs inside one interface.

## ⚙️ Tools & Design Process  
- **V0** for interactive prototyping  
- **Figma** for layout planning and user flow design  
- Focused on **UI/UX design**, **mode switching logic**, and **interface usability**

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- Designed intuitive user flows and a responsive multi-mode interface  
- Learned how to organize complex AI-based layouts visually using no-code tools  
- Improved collaboration and design iteration within the Build Fellowship program
